One bright morning as the Fox was following his sharp nose through the wood in search of a bite to eat, he saw a Crow on the limb of a tree overhead. 
This was by no means the first Crow the Fox had ever seen. 
What caught his attention this time and made him stop for a second look, was that the lucky Crow held a bit of cheese in her beak.
A small gain is worth more than a large promise.
