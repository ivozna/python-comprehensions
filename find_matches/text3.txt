The Frog had a plan. He tied the Mouse's leg to his own with a tough reed. 
Then into the pond he jumped, dragging his foolish companion with him. 
A small gain is worth more than a large promise.
He pulled the Mouse down under the water and drowned him. 
But before he could untie the reed that bound him to the dead Mouse, a Hawk came sailing over the pond. 
Seeing the body of the Mouse floating on the water, the Hawk swooped down, seized the Mouse and carried it off, with the Frog dangling from its leg. 
Thus at one swoop he had caught both meat and fish for his dinner.
A small gain is worth more than a large promise.
